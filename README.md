# Hunt-the-Wumpus
A re-make of an early computer game, based on a hide-and-seek format. 
In one of the 63 rooms in a map, a sleeping monster (Wumpus) resides. 
There are also 4 bats and 4 bottomless pits scattered around the map. 

Entering a room with a bat: Bat lifts you up and takes you to a random room
Entering a room with a bottomless pit/Wumpus: Instant death
Entering a room that is adjacent to a bat, a pit, or a wumpus will give the user corresponding hint messages. 

The user's job is to navigate the rooms using only the room numbers and hints given by the game, and to shoot the Wumpus before it moves to eat you.
